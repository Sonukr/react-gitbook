# Introduction

Welcome to General Assembly's React.js lesson!

This lesson assumes you have some JavaScript knowledge and awareness of the DOM tree.

Beyond that, we'll be here to teach you!

> One note: Because this is a pilot, we are working out how long sections take to translate this to in class timings. Every few sections, there will be a survey on how long you've spent on the previous sections and whether the sections were useful.
> Please fill them out! 

And with that, let''s learn!
